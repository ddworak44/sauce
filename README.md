# sauce
Twitter bot used to find original tweets from screenshots. 

Using tweepy, opencv-python, pytesseract. 

# What does it do? 
Have you ever been on twitter and you see a screenshot to a tweet?

If you're like me, you want to see if it's real or the funny replies to the original.

Now, all you have to do is reply to the tweet with sauce-bot, and it will look for the original. 

# 0.0.1

The first release will simply be to see if we can get all of the dependencies configured. I know twitter is changing its API policies, but we will act is if everything's good to go.
